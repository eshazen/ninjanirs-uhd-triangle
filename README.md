Working on attachment to ninjaCap.  Trying some small retaining rings
from McMaster:

| Item | P/N       | OD    | Groove wid | Groove dia |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|------------|
| 1    | 98410A111 | 1/8"  | .012"      | .117"      |
| 2    | 98410A815 | 5/32" | .012"      | .146"      |
| 3    | 98410A110 | 3/16" | .018"      | .175"      |

Printing a test peg for number 3 (A110)

* Peg dia = 0.177
* groove wid = 0.018
* grove dia = 0.168

Using 0.2mm nozzle
<br>Profile "0.06mm High Quality @BBL X1C 0.2 nozzle"

Fits nicely, but clip probably not wide enough to secure to flexible
cap.  Maybe a plastic or metal washer under the clip?
